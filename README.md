Eyes is an exercise where a marker moves along the bus stops from MIT campus to Harvard campus.
## How to Run
Make sure index.html, styles.css, and manipulation.js are on your local computer. Next, you can drag index.html into your browser and you should see a map from mapbox appear centered on a set of coordinates dispalying Harvard and MIT campuses in the browser screen.
## Future Improvements
I would like to use different coordinates in my town of Tacoma to track a local bus route I used to take to get to my university. I would use the move function to set markers that stayed on the map and didn't disappear until the user clicked a new button called back. This would erase all markers on the map and return the bus route animation from end back to the beginning.
